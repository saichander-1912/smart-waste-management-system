Waste management is a significant challenge for governments, often due to inadequate monitoring that leads to overflowing bins despite sufficient bin placement.
This project proposes a solution in the form of "Smart Bins," which leverage ESP8266 technology to process data and transmit it to ThingSpeak. Key data transmitted 
includes the bin’s location, fullness status, service status, and type (biodegradable or non-biodegradable). The system also features a handheld device for municipal
drivers, powered by Arduino Uno, allowing them to interact with the system, locate bins, and update their statuses. Additionally, a GSM module sends the bin’s location
to drivers when service is required. To assess bin health, the design incorporates an ultrasonic sensor, weight sensor, and gas sensor. For administrators, a comprehensive
monitoring and reporting system provides real-time tracking and monthly summaries. A public-facing complaint registration system is also included, enabling citizens to report 
waste management issues. Smell detection sensors facilitate the prompt removal of contaminated waste, ensuring faster and more efficient service.
